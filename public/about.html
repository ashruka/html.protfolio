<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>We have been creating Entertainment, relationship, and motivational 
videos on YouTube and other social media platforms since 2018. 
We center on creating content to solve social problems while entertaining 
and inspiring others for a better future. </p>

<p>In 2018 on the telegram app, we received a lot of stories of life struggles, 
especially from Ethiopians women who have been working in Arab countries such as Lebanon, 
and Saudi Arabia. In our group (telegram app), a lot of discussions were 
raised and many of the girls got a solution from their peer ideas and the admin (Ashruka). 
That was the main reason enlightened us to think big and create more content to solve relationship 
problems and raise the voice of the voiceless. </p>

<p>We believe ideas matter and sharing ideas would lead to greatness and happiness. 
We will open a door to sharing good ideas to improve the life of society and 
to motivate others to a better life.Besides, we are providing social media marketing services, 
mainly based on content promotion, with a high reach and affordable price.</p>
